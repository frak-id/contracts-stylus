## Content Consumption Tracker Contract for Arbitrum Stylus

This repository houses the Rust implementation of the Content Consumption Tracker contract for the Arbitrum Stylus network.

**Contract Overview**

The Content Consumption Tracker contract is designed to securely record and verify user engagement with content across various platforms on the Arbitrum Stylus blockchain. 

It provides a reliable mechanism for tracking content consumption data, leveraging cryptographic techniques to ensure data integrity. 

**Key Features:**

* **Platform Integration:** Platforms can easily integrate with the contract to track user activity. 
* **Cryptographic Verification:**  The contract utilizes BLS signatures, a robust cryptographic scheme, to verify the authenticity of content consumption data submitted by users. 
* **Efficient and Transparent:**  The contract is designed for efficient operation and provides a transparent record of content consumption on the Arbitrum Stylus blockchain. 

**Development**

This contract is being developed in Rust, tailored for the Arbitrum Stylus WASM environment. 

**Deployment**

Deployment details will be provided in a separate deployment guide.
